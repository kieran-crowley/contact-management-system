# contact-management-system

uses very simple tech, html, css, node, javascript and some jquery and SQL, this allowed me to get alot done in a short period of time. although far from perfect. given more time i would focus more on production level code. error handling and error checkling along with better looks and accessability and user experiance.

installationL
clone from github,npm i, npm run start.

TASK:

You are tasked with developing a contact management system that enables users to add, view, edit, and delete contact information. The system should be capable of handling basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for contact entries. Each contact should have the following fields:
• Name
• Email
• Phone Number
• Address (optional)
Include the ability to search for contacts by their name, email or city, a single search input should suffice. Whilst building your solution, please keep in mind that user input is not always correct, handling any errors gracefully and ensuring invalid data is never stored in the database.
While styling is important in the real world, for this technical test, we want to primarily focus on assessing the logic and functionality of your submission. We are intentionally leaving the styling aspects open for you to come up with your own creative and user-friendly design.
